# City Fish Market
City Fish Market was originally a web design project that I completed in college. I decided to put my dev skills to the test and try to bring it to life. It was developed locally with Flywheel. The nav is fixed and updates as you scroll, thereâ€™s a Slick JS carousel, Google map API is integrated, and there are several post type loops.
